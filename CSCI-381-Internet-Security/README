This folder contains all the code for CS 381 taking in Spring 2017 taught by Dr. Bon Sy.

Brief Description:
SmallRSACracker is designed to find the decoder in an RSA encryption system.  However, this only works with long. It will
work perfectly under most conditions but it is limited by the 64 bit constraint of long.
BigRSACracker is the upgrade to SmallRSA cracker as it will use BigInteger. It is still a work in Progress.
