2) Create a method that asks the user for a number. Use a JOptionPane.
Create an array of characters (chars) which is of equal size to the string that the user input.
Using a for loop, check each char in the String that the user input to make sure they are all digits. (use the API documentation to see which method of class Character that you should use).
If any of the characters are not a digit, display an appropriate message to the user using another JOptionPane.
If all of the characters are digits, display in JoptionPane the number in reverse. (hint, use another for loop to create a string of all the characters).
