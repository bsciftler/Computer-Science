Analysis:

This problem is similar to the Reader/Writer problem example 
shown in class.
The goal of this project is to have both customers and bartenders threads.
But with heavy drinking, it takes stages to get drunk.
To keep things simple, there will be three stages.
- Feeling nice
- Feeling lit
- Feeling trashed
As all the customers had just got accepted to pretigious universties, they think they 
deserve to get so drunk that they need to have an Uber bring them home.

For all customers to get that drunk, the bartenders will set priorities on who gets drinks first.

1- Arrival time of customers
2- Are the customers attractive/plesant to the bartenders?
This will either increase or decrease priority of the customer needing to get their dirnk
This progam will use the default priority of 5.
A bartender maybe ambivalent to the customer.
3- Do the customers tip the bartender?
Some of the customers will tip the bartender.  This will increase the priority depending on 
how generous the tip is to the bartender.

Algorithmn:
1- Customers come in the bar.
2- Bartenders decide if they are "hit" or "FineAF"
3- Customers get their first drinks, (STARVATION POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE, SEMAPHORE TO PREVENT THIS!)
4- Customers are allowed to tip.
5- Priority changes, customers are given more alcohol
6- Repeat steps 3-6.
7- By now, all customers should be drunk, kill them off (or get them home...)
