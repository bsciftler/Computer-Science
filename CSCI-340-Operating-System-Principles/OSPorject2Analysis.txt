Analysis:

This problem is similar to the Reader/Writer problem example 
shown in class.
The goal of this project is to have both customers and bartenders threads.
But with heavy drinking, it takes stages to get drunk.
To keep things simple, there will be for stages.
- Feeling sober (Starting State)
- Feeling nice
- Feeling lit
- Feeling trashed
As all the customers had had a hard day of work and their goal is to get completely drunk.
For all customers to get that drunk, the bartenders will set priorities on who gets drinks first.
All bartenders will have normal priority of all customers, which is thread priority 5.

1- Are the Bartenders comfortable with the customer?
If so, increase their priority.

2- Do the customers tip the bartender?
Some of the customers will tip the bartender.  This will increase the priority depending on 
how generous the tip is to the bartender.

3- Is the customer rude? 
If so, decrease their priority.

All customers will be drunk after 3 drinks to make this project easier.

Algorithmn:
1- Customers come in the bar.
2- Bartenders decide if they are getting a good vibe or not. 
3- Customers get their first drinks.
For this problem to require semaphores, we can set that there will be 5 customers and 2 bartenders.
This means that since 2 bartenders can't attend more than one person at a time. If they are both occupied the other cusomters must wait.
4- Customers are allowed to tip, which will potential increase their priority.
5- Repeat steps 3-4.
6- By now, all customers should be drunk, (send them home by using the System.exit(0).
