Assignment #1 holds the instructions for this project.

Dr. Chao Chen has created the interfaces to make it clear what methods he wanted to see in the project.
He also created the following classes:
ArrayMain
ArraySparseVec
ArraySparseM
The point of the classes was to give the class an idea of what he wanted to see when creating the LLSparseM and LLSparseVec class.
