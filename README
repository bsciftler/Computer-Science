This repository contains all my computer science related work.
The seperate folders contain all homework assignments for the Computer Science classes I took.
All my recreational projects will be on the main branch page. As of now, I am working on creating a Linear Algebra Class. It will have functions such as:
1) Matrix Multiplication (Completed)
2) Matrix Addition (Completed)
3) Eigenvalues (In Progress)
4) Determinants (IP) (I will use Jordan-Gauss elimination to create an Upper Triangular matrix so it is scalable for large matrices)
5) Using Matrix Multiplication to generate differential equations. (In Progess)
6) Using Matrix Multiplication to do Integration (In Progess)
I will probably draw inpiration from my other math coureses to build other classes in due time.

I have also created some bash scripts that serve as intrusion detection for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. I intend to update them during the summer to work for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and place the scripts here.
