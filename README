This repository contains all my computer science related work.
The seperate folders contain all homework assignments for the Computer Science classes I took.
The "Other" Folder contains some other classes I made for fun. As of now it contains a basic protoype for a class that do computations related to Linear Algebra and Statistics.

I have also created some bash scripts that serve as intrusion detection for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. I intend to update them during the summer to work for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and place the scripts here.
