This repository contains all my work that is computer science related.
All my recreational projects will be on the main branch page. As of now, I want to complete a Linear Algebra class that will have all the functions such as determinant, matrix multiplication, etc. 
The seperate folders contain all homework assignments for the Computer Science classes I took.
