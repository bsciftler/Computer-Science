This repository contains all my computer science related work.
The seperate folders contain all homework assignments for the Computer Science classes I took.
All my recreational projects will be on the main branch page. As of now, I am working on creating a Linear Algebra Class. It will have functions such as:
1) Matrix Multiplication (Completed)
2) Matrix Addition (Completed)
3) Eigenvalues (IP)
4) Determinants (IP) (I will probably use Jordan-Gauss elimination for the challenge and it is more scalable for larger matrices)
5) Using Matrix Multiplication to generate differential equations. (IP) 
6) Using Matrix Multiplication to do Integration (IP)
I will probably draw inpiration from my other math coureses to build other classes in due time.
